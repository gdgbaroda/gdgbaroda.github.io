### FAQs

<br />
#### What is a GDG?

GDGs (Google Developers Groups) are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.

#### How will GDG help me as a professional?
As a professional, you will be able to 'catch up' with various Google products and would be able to use them in your work environment. You can also ask us for assistance on various Google products and platforms and we will be able help you get connected with the right people. We also value your feedback as a professional user of products and hence we also relay back important feedback to the Google product teams which in turn helps Google build better products.

#### I am a student. How will joining a GDG help me?
As a student, you will be learning how to use new Google products and even the concepts behind them (TensorFlow and machine learning, for example!). Plus, you will be able to connect with professionals building your network and might even help you getting an internship or a job! Plus, giving a talk on something you are good at is a way of giving back to the community that nurtured you.

#### Do I need to be a coder/developer to join GDG Baroda?
Absolutely not! At GDG Baroda, we have graphic designers, start-up enthusiasts and college students who are not acquainted with coding. GDG is not just a developer community; it is much more than that!

#### Where and when do you guys meet?
Our meeting place is not usually fixed(subject to availability of the place). But it will be a nice, safe and sound place! We usually meet once a month. You can checkup our next meetup and connect with us on our [meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/gdgbaroda/).

#### Can I share my office space or personal space for a meetup?
Sure! But it is advisable to talk about this to the organizers before hosting a meetup at your place.
