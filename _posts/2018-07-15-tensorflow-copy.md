When we all at [ GDG Baroda](https://twitter.com/gdgbaroda "GDG Baroda Twitter account" ) got updates for the first time that another [Tensorflow Dev Summit](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/) is happening this February at Mountain View, we were damn excited! We were hoping high from Tensorflow team and expecting even more exciting announcements than the last summit. The Tensorflow Dev Summit brings together over 500 TensorFlow users in-person and thousands tuning into the live stream at TensorFlow events around the world, and GDG Baroda was one of them. During this event, Google makes new product announcements along with technical talks from the TensorFlow team and guest speakers

But there was a twist, instead of live streaming, we wanted to something different to make Machine Learning easy for first-timers. Fortunately, we’ve many Machine Learning engineers in our own community, who were willing to share their knowledge and experience. Their name and topic of the session are given below:

- Keynote by [Sneh Pandya]( https://twitter.com/SnehPandya18 ) 
- How to get started with Machine Learning by [Krupa Galiya]( https://twitter.com/Krupagaliya )
- Create sequential models using Keras by [Dhrumil Barot]( https://twitter.com/barotdhrumil21 )
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob by [Daniel Phiri]( https://twitter.com/malgamves )
- Pytorch vs Tensorflow by [Dhruv Apte]( https://twitter.com/apte_dhruv )

The event kicked off with an amazing keynote by Sneh Pandya, our own meetup organizer. He gave the introduction about GDG Baroda and Tensorflow. If you’re new to we can’t recommend enough this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) to get started with Tensorflow by Josh Gordon, Machine Learning Developer advocate at Google. We watched the pre-recorded keynote by Jeff Dean from Tensorflow Dev Summit. Well first thing first, all JavaScript developers were happy because they don’t have to learn Python anymore to do Machine Learning now. Another pretty exciting updates include the release of [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/), [Tensorflow for Swift]( https://github.com/tensorflow/swift ), [TensorRT]( https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt ) and [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/). We'll discuss more about all this, in upcoming posts.

Next session was “How to get started with Machine Learning” by Krupa Galiya; another rising star in GDG community. The motive of this talk was to introduce Machine Learning to first-timers. As she said  "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to LEARN with data, without being explicitly programmed"

There are mainly 3 types of machine learning approach to achieve Artificial Intelligence: 

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

She shared her experience of how she started with machine learning 2 years and course by (Andrew NG on Coursera)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning] helped her a lot. She made also said [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), also from Coursera and [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) on Udemy are also a good place to start. One more thing to note here is learning maths is not necessary to get started with machine learning but it’s recommended if you seriously want to pursue machine learning later on. She also shared tips & tricks, prerequisites, and more resources for beginners to get started with Machine Learning. Link to resources are given at the end of this article, make sure to check it out.

​    
That's it for today’s post. We’ll continue our journey in the upcoming post.
