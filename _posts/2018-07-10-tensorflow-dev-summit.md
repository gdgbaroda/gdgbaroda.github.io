When we all at [ GDG Baroda](https://twitter.com/gdgbaroda "GDG Baroda Twitter account" ) got updates for the first time that another [Tensorflow Dev Summit](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/) is happening this February at Mountain View, we were damn excited! We were hoping high from Tensorflow team and expecting even more exciting announcements than the last summit. The Tensorflow Dev Summit brings together over 500 TensorFlow users in-person and thousands tuning into the live stream at TensorFlow events around the world, and GDG Baroda was one of them. During this event, Google makes new product announcements along with technical talks from the TensorFlow team and guest speakers.

But there was a twist, instead of live streaming, we wanted to something different to make Machine Learning easy for first-timers. Fortunately, we’ve many Machine Learning engineers in our own community, who were willing to share their knowledge and experience. Their name and topic of the session are given below:

- Keynote by [Sneh Pandya]( https://twitter.com/SnehPandya18 ) 
- How to get started with Machine Learning by [Krupa Galiya]( https://twitter.com/Krupagaliya )
- Create sequential models using Keras by [Dhrumil Barot]( https://twitter.com/barotdhrumil21 )
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob by [Daniel Phiri]( https://twitter.com/malgamves )
- Pytorch vs Tensorflow by [Dhruv Apte]( https://twitter.com/apte_dhruv )

The event kicked off with an amazing keynote by Sneh Pandya, our own meetup organizer. He gave the introduction about GDG Baroda and Tensorflow. If you’re new to we can’t recommend enough this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) to get started with Tensorflow by Josh Gordon. We watched the pre-recorded keynote by Jeff Dean from Tensorflow Dev Summit. Well first thing first, with the release of [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) all JavaScript developers were pretty happy because they don’t have to learn Python anymore to do Machine Learning now. Another pretty exciting updates include the release of [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/), [Tensorflow for Swift]( https://github.com/tensorflow/swift ), [TensorRT]( https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt ) and [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/). Don't worry, we'll discuss more about all this, in upcoming posts.

Next session was “How to get started with Machine Learning” by Krupa Galiya; another rising star in GDG community. The motive of this talk was to introduce Machine Learning to first-timers. As she said  "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to LEARN with data, without being explicitly programmed"

The upcoming session was by our own rockstar, Daniel Phiri on Twitter Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob. He showed us how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets in real time. Attendees were really amazed by trying sentiment analysis on tweets for the first time, on their own. Yes, you heard it right, beginners got their hands dirty with machine learning and that too without any high-end computer. Google released an online tool called [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) to help disseminate machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. 

Next session was on, well it was not a session actually. We people at GDG Baroda are fun loving guys and playing Kahoot is like an addiction. So, how can we miss it this time? Our rockstar GDG lead Rahul Banker is our favorite quiz master and he really knows his job. Don’t believe me? Then join us for the  upcoming event and see yourself and it's good chance to win goodies as well. Here’s a glimpse of quiz:

The last session was on “Create sequential models using Keras” by  Dhrumil Barot. He showed a demo on emotion detection using machine learning and all attendees got a chance to perform it on their machine as well. 

Due to some constraints, Dhruv was not able to deliver the talk on "Pytorch vs Tensorflow". Though you can find his presentation from the link given at the end of this article.

 As our tradition at GDG Baroda, we had about an hour long networking session after completion of all sessions. We find it pride to shape rising star’s career by guiding them in a proper direction.

See you in the upcoming event at GDG Baroda.
