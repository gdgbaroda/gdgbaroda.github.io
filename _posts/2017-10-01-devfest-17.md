What came into your mind when you heard the word ‚ÄúDevFest‚Äù for the first time? Well, as per official [website](https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/)  - GDG DevFests are large, community-run developer events happening around the globe focused on community building and learning about Google‚Äôs technologies. But as our GDG Baroda lead Manan Jadhav says - Normal people have festivals like Navratri, Christmas, Diwali, and we developers have our own festival like DevFest; where we learn new things about Android, Web, and Cloud, make friends and have fun (of course). This time in 2017, GDG Baroda DevFest was held at Four Points by Sheraton on 1st October.

##### Some of the titbits from DevFest 17 are:

- One of the most special and exciting thing about DevFest 17 was, we had Mr. Dushyant Jadeja from Google that time. He answered some of the queries from the audience as well, one of the most interesting ones was ‚ÄúHow to join Google?‚Äù. If you have the same query, attend DevFest 18 and you can ask it yourself.üòâ

- A new initiative, Women Techmakers was announced, which is women community to share their passion, ideas, knowledge through various sessions, workshops. Mamata Gelanee is newly appointed WTM Baroda lead now. If you're Women in Tech, feel free to join [WTM Baroda](https://twitter.com/WTMBaroda).

- It was all possible just because of our hardworking GDG leads, a team of volunteers and the support from the DevRel team of Google.
