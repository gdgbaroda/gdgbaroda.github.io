"DevFest" is the most awaited fest for all the Google developers. A quick glance for the new people from the official [DevFest website](https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/) - DevFests are community-led developer events hosted by Google Developer Groups around the globe. GDGs are focused on community building and learning about Google technologies. 

Being superior - above all the traditions, GDG Baroda in 2019 was announced for two days. The first day being codelabs and second day being the main DevFest day made it more excited. Speakers coming from all over India made everyone more involved into it that we had houseful events on both the days.

The codelabs were really interactive and informative. The cherry on the cake was making innovative patterns with IOT. There were 10 teams giving light patterns with varied ideas in limited time and we had three winners. It was really fun!

The community conflicts and solutions were showcased by [Hardik Mistry](https://twitter.com/mistryhardik05). Also GDG Baroda team had created a registration app using QR scanning and other technologies, which had already been used at DevFest 2019. We made this app open source thus anyone can contribue for it or use it to learn these technologies.
