"Success" mostly starts with a dream and firm motive to achieve it. But the secret behind my story is grabbing all the opportunities coming my way! Paths can be different but the destination is always same.

Doing what I like is Engineering,
Liking what I do is Blogging!!

Blogging is the main core that made me achieve all of it, starting from connecting with my old friends (making them read) to exploring the different Google software. And the lead to acquaint me of Google was successfully done by [GDG Baroda](https://gdgbaroda.com/).

I still remember the month of November 2017 when I attended [GDG Baroda](https://gdgbaroda.com/) meetup for the first time - It was a friendly session with the inauguration of [WTM Baroda](https://twitter.com/WTMBaroda). Honestly, I didn't had any idea at that point of time what I was even doing there! Then I started attending monthly meetups hoping to learn about trending technologies. Meanwhile, I had my Blogspot account and published my first blog on March 8 - International Women's Day.

The best opportunity came next was Devfest - Yearly fest of GDG Baroda 2018. I had filled up the volunteering form to work with the website development team, different from what my friends have already chosen! I didn't knew anything about Jekyll that we had to work on, but the fate wanted me to write! (Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for different websites.) I had also learned about Markdown and node.js when some task was assigned to me. Never say "I don't know" because it's never too late to learn!

Women Techmakers Baroda then had their forms out to establish the lead and core committee. I definitely didn't want to miss this opportunity and I was in - I was selected as a core committee member. By then, I had a good networking with most of people there. One of them was already contributing for "Google Maps" and wanted me to write some post for its event. It was the next opportunity to explore when I didn't even knew that it was 'US' who contribute on Google Maps. That evening I went from 0 to 100 to gain information about Google Maps! Now, I am a local guide at Level 5 with 1152 points.

It was January 2019 and I hardly had 7 blogs since March 2018. One of my friend really liked my blogs and told me that 'If you are so good at writing, why won't you earn through it!' And my "Google AdSense" account was made by her that day (Every friend is precious!). I promised myself to be active with blogs now. I started writing blogs and sharing it on Twitter, which again I learned to use with WTM Baroda at some event. WTM also helped me giving a platform to be a 'public speaker' at different meetups!

Working with dreams, we always have different hurdles. There was a time when I also thought to quit writing blogs! Community Members had a role in my life - Even though a friend is totally messed up with their own life, they give best motivating advices to us. I continued writing again and to my surprise - My AdSense account have been activated a month back. Again I explored it completely in two days and hoping to learn something new everyday like my blogs are now directly accessed by "Google - Search Engines" when approved by AdSense!

Success may not come in a day or two, instead it requires a lot of patience. But trust me, our each and every effort is counted and summed up to be back to us one day! Its still not too late for you to learn.

Work hard and smart to have your own identities!
