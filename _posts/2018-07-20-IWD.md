* Deep Learning Course on Udacity
* Andrew's Machine Learning course on coursera

### Women In Silicon Valley:
#### Speaker: Darshil Bhatt
There was a brief description on lack of women in tech as compared to men. This leaves them in minority which is not a good sign. Darshil proposed many ways to empower them and generate more participation to overcome gender inequality.

### Dream it, Do it:

This one started with Surbhi’s story of becoming an entrepreneur. She mentioned her dedication until her illusion became reality. This one was the major highlight of the whole event which gave a role model to the female audience.

### We>men
#### Speaker: Daniel Phiri
Daniel basically pointed towards the gender inequality in our society, and how today’s women have overcome male dominance in every field. He also included how women are becoming self- dependent and working on execution of their dream to become what they desire to be.

##### At the cease we had a really persuasive session hosted by Mamta Gelanee which encouraged people to be the part of community, she pointed towards the pros of being more social which  included:

* ##### Having a large network
* ##### Learning new stuff
* ##### Helping Each other
* ##### A competitive environment

And much more...

Hence if we conclude we had successful meet IWD which may be the milestone for the female audiences. Everybody had a great time meeting new people and building a true inseparable bond with the people never thought of and achieving stuff never dreamt of.
