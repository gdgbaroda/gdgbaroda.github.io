Looking at enormous application of cloud based service, in Feb 2017 [GDG Baroda](https://gdgbaroda.com/) organized meetup on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)(GCP) named Cloud Study Jams, lead by co-organizers. Just like everytime, this time also attendees were so excited when they got confirmation about this meetup as they were going to explore & learn something really new stuff. Meetup began with introduction of GCP.

### What is GCP?
GCP stands for Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or bank account details. Google Cloud Platform provides Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Serverless Computing environments. Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and Google Maps. In April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud computing service from the company. Attendees did their hands-on practice on the GCP Labs under the credits which were given to GDG Baroda for 30 days.

### Why GCP?
Google differs from other cloud providers in a variety of ways. Below are some highlights.

#### Google-grade security
The Google security model is an end-to-end process, built on over 16 years of experience focused on keeping customers safe on Google applications like Gmail and Google Apps. With Google Cloud Platform your applications and data take advantage of the same security model.

#### Billing by the second
Compute Engine instances are charged in one-second increments with a one-minute minimum, so you don't pay for compute minutes that you don't use. Learn more about billing.

#### Big data
 GCP big data analytics solutions are serverless, removing the complexity of building and maintaining a data analytics system, so you can accelerate your time-to-insight.

#### Global network
Google's backbone network has thousands of miles of fiber optic cable, uses advanced software-defined networking, and has edge caching services to deliver fast, consistent and scalable performance. In fact, we even laid our own fiber optic cable under the Pacific Ocean.

#### Environmentally friendly
GCP data centers run on half the energy of a typical data center, and run on 100% renewable energy where available. Learn more about renewable energy in Google data centers.

### Advantages of using GCP
Top seven advantages of choosing  GCP are listed below.

* Better Pricing Than Competitors

* Private Global Fiber Network

* Live Migration of Virtual Machines

* Improved Performance

* State of the Art Security

* Dedication to Continued Expansion

* Redundant Backups
